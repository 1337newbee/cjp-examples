README for Checking Java Programs accompanying files.

1) This directory is set up as an Eclipse project and as an Ant-buildable project.

2) When you install it YOU WILL HAVE TO SET some Eclipse variables before it will work!
This is expected. Emails asking why it doesn't work out of the box when you haven't
read this file are going to be ignored, but you won't know that if you didn't read
this file; that's why it's called README.txt, I suppose.

It tells you in the book how to set these variables, in case you don't know.

3) There is no #3; see items 1 and 2 above.

Thanks for reading Checking Java Programs!
