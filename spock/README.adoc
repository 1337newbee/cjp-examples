== Spock Demos

Spock is a nice new testing framework that leverages JUnit tooling.
http://spockframework.org/ is their home base.

*N.B.* The FailureDemo.groovy script is supposed to show failure.
However, to ensure that tests pass "out of the box", it's disabled;
you have to edit it and un-comment the indicated line.

*N.B.* The database test will probably only work with my database setup.
You probably need to change the database JDBC parameters near the top
of this file in order for it to work for you.
